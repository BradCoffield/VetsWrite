VetsWrite is a collaboration between fiction writer and program manager Ashley Kunsa and web designer Brad Coffield. We aim to deliver high quality, no-cost, creative writing instruction to southwestern Pennsylvania’s veterans, service members, and their families, so that these individuals can find creative ways to express themselves and tell stories that are an important part of our shared culture. Through www.vetswrite.com, as well as public readings, we hope to bring participants’ work to the community at-large—building an artistic bridge between the 1% and the society they have served.
