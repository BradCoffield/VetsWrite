       <div class="columns large-8"><h3>What is VetsWrite?</h3><p>At VetsWrite we want to give veterans, active duty service members, and their adult family members the tools and space to tell their storiesâ€”and to share them with our community. Each session will focus on a different creative writing concept in order to help you bring your military, post-military, and/or home front experiences to life on the page.</p>
       <p>VetsWrite seeks to act as a bridge between servicemen and women who served in different conflicts, in the reserves, and stateside, and at the same time to offer the healing benefits of story-telling in a safe, trusting environment. The public reading provides the opportunity to share your valuable stories with community.</p>
       <p>All events are free, and participants may attend as many or as few workshop sessions as they like. Sessions will be led by fiction writer Ashley Kunsa.</p><h3>The Artist</h3><p>Workshops are led by Ashley Kunsa, a fiction writer whose work has appeared in numerous venues including The Los Angeles Review and The Roanoke Review. She's been teaching writing since 2006. More info</p></div>
